# Finite-Element-Simulation-Square-Plate
In this repository, vibration simulations of a square plate is being studied using finite element method (FM).
This example shows how to calculate the vibration modes and frequencies of a 3-D simply supported, square, and elastic plate.

Two different types of meshing functions are adopted (Hmin VS Hmax) both with 1.3 of maximum/minimum target grids.

Results of the adopted FEM simulations are compared with the benchmark. Excluding the rigid modes (first 3 modes), the 4th and the 5th modes are plotted:

It is good to note that, FM is a powerful numerical method to study vibratory response of complicated geometries (natural frequencies, mode shapes).
